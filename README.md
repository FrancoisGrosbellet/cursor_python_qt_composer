# Cursor Python Qt Composer

This repository contains a Python/Qt To-Do List application created entirely using Cursor Composer, an AI-powered code generation tool. The purpose of this project is to benchmark and showcase the capabilities of Cursor Composer in creating a functional application without human-written code.

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates:
- The use of Python and Qt for creating a graphical user interface
- Implementation of a To-Do List manager with CRUD operations
- Data persistence using JSON file storage
- Integration of AI-generated code to build a complete, working application

## Key Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Set due dates for tasks
- View task descriptions
- Progress bar showing completion status of all tasks
- Ability to delete all tasks at once
- Data persistence between sessions

## Technology Stack

- Python
- PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- JSON for data storage
- Cursor Composer (AI code generation tool)

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main application logic and GUI implementation
- `model.py`: Implements the data model for tasks and file operations
- `tasks.json`: Stores the task data
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```
3. Run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Code Generation Process

All code in this repository has been generated using Cursor Composer. This includes:
- Python scripts (`main.py`, `model.py`)
- JSON data file structure
- .gitignore file
- This README file

No manual coding or editing was performed by human developers.

## Limitations and Considerations

While this project showcases the power of AI-generated code, it's important to note that AI tools like Cursor Composer are assistive technologies. They can greatly speed up development and provide innovative solutions, but human oversight and validation are still crucial for production-ready applications.

## Contributing

As this is a benchmark project for AI-generated code, we are not accepting direct contributions. However, feedback on the performance and capabilities of the AI-generated application is welcome.
